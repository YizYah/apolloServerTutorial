Apollo Server with Unit Testing Partial Solution
----------
This is a partial solution (reflecting only the steps covered the [tutorial for a TS Apollo Server with Unit Tests](https://medium.com/p/4ab14ac46654/edit).)

The whole point of this is to show how to test an Apollo Server using neo4j with [neo-forgery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo-forgery).

To run the test, first run `npm i` and then 
call `npm test`.
